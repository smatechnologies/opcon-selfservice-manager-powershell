# OpConsole Self Service Manager
This terminal program is designed to help manage Self Service buttons between OpCon environments from a command line.

# Prerequisites
* <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases">Powershell 7+</a>
* Powershell Module - Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools 
* OpCon environments on Release 19+
* OpCon license with access to OpCon API

# Instructions
To install the Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools modules do the following:
```
Install-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools 
```

Run the program in OpCon or from a command line like this:
```
pwsh OpConsole_SS_Mgr.ps1 -cli -srcToken "1234567890" -srcURL "https://<server>:<port>" -destToken "5678901234" -destURL "https://<server>:<port>" -button "My Button"
```

Launch the terminal gui like this:
```
pwsh OpConsole_SS_Mgr.ps1
```

Once launched, go to the Connection/s -> Select Environment area to select an environment to authenticate too or to add a new one.

After authenticating select Navigation -> Manage Self Service.  Choose an option from the Self Service menu, select Buttons or Categories to display the items in your active environment (that your role has access too):
![Buttons](documentation/imgs/OpConsoleSSButtons.JPG)

You can then select the "SUBMIT" option to copy the button or category of buttons to the destination OpCon environment!  The role for the button will default to "ocadm" but any existing categories will carry over if they exist in the destination OpCon environment (if the category does not exist in the destination environment, it will be set to none).
